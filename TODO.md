# TODO

Making this more usable:

 - check in the linux wheelhouse for use when building the zip for aws
 - Clarify AWS steps
 - Maybe cli script to use awscli to run on AWS

Things we'd like to test for:

- Time-to-interactive
- Time until run actually starts
- Framerate during run (peak/nadir/average?)

Scenarios we'd still like to test:

- Just backgrounds
- Longer runtimes
